PLEASE NOTE THE HASHMAP SEARCH DOES NOT WORK, I COULD NOT FIGURE IT OUT.
I REPLACED IT WITH MY OLD SEARCH
ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS WORK.


This program is a day planner program. It allows the user to add and
search for events stored in the planner using array lists.

Test Cases
Documented in testing file.

Searching is quite simple, it does not matter where the element is located in the array, whether 

1. the given element is not on the list;

2. the given element is at the start of the list;

3. the given element is at the end of the list;

4. the given element is somewhere in the list.

For file input and output, files must be located in the "files" folder in the root directory of the project.
To keep things simple, i names them input.txt and output.txt
When opening the program, it will look at the first and possible second command line arguments and run the
program using those parameters.
The first is either input or output, if input, it populates an arraylist with activities found in the file.
If output, it prints the lists to file when completed.
