To use my program, type "make" in the command line.
This compiles the library, the needed files for ParameterManager, all
Object files needed and the Dialogc file.

To run the program, type java Dialogc in the command line.

The GUI admittedly is incomplete.
Keyboard shortcuts work, such as CTRL-S to save.
Buttons all have functionality except for Stop, as I could not run the
file within my own java window.
To compile the other file, go to its directory, and type javac <filename>.java

The editor works well, tracks changes and for the most part
save directories.

Compiling allows you to choose where the .java file is saved.

About displays my student info, and dates.

Help should display what you see here.

All the things in the "config" menu don't work.

So, it's not finished, but I tried. Here's the submission.
